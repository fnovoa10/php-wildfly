To use the php servlet with jbossas-4.2.x and jbossas-5.0.x you need to
replace jbossas jbossweb-extras.jar by the one of provided by the php
package.
This is fixed in jbossweb 2.0.1.CR7 (so in jbossas since 4.2.2.GA and 5.0.0.Beta3).

This jbossweb-extras.jar doesn't contain the RewriteValve.

It is also possible to use it with jbossas-4.0.x just copy jbossweb-extras.jar
to jbossweb-tomcat55.sar.
